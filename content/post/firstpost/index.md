## Recent things firstâ€¦
Like 3-4 hours ago, i RM -RF'ed my local hugo server :<

The thing is, my git cannot send the main directory (layouts, data, etc)
and i ask chatGPT what can i do to fix it, but the AI is answer like "just use this command to fix it all, but this is can cause files loss" but my dumbass brain just copy & paste the git command without reading it finishly and yea as chatGPT says, the command is deleting the most important directory and yea thats was stressing fr, but after that i was just go to gym to fix my mood (it works)

## Something we can learn today...
Don't just copy & paste anything from AI. Thats it.
