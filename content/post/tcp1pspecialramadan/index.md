Those all was incredible experience!! i learned so much things, like how respond of their struggle patiently (real), make a good description of the challs, and of course making the challs, i meant, for making an easy challs is hard, like u need to build it, and also test it, make sure your challs is not broken.

and yeah THATS IT!!! i want to become probset again (pls), becoming probset is way funnier than a normal player (ofc)

ALSO i will make write-ups of my challs too! so stay tune!!
