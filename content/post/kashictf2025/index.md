## KashiCTF 2025
So today, i just played CTF event with `TCP1P`, and we play on Kashi CTF.

![](tcp1pleaderboard.png)

We got position on 45/709 teams.

KashiCTF is CTF event organized by `IIT(BHU)CyberSec`, it is University from India, Banaras Hindu University. They created many chall categories, Webex, Reversing, Binex, Osint, Forensic, and Crypto. 

from all those chall, i managed to solved 2 Webex, 5 Foren, 2 Jail, 2 Rev and 2 Crypto.

and this is my write-up
## Web Exploitation
### SuperFastAPI
###### Desc: Made my verty first API! However I have to still integrate it with a frontend so can't do much at this point lol.
we got a web service, and this the looks like
![](fastapiweb.png)

there is no front end/UI literally, pure just fetching from API.
and of course there is no source code, and i decided to find the active directory
#### Solver
![](fastapidirec.png)
we got the endpoint on `/docs`, this is the UI looks like
![](fastiapidocs.png)

as you can see, there is '/flag', but we need to make account first, after make account, if u try to get the flag, the output will like this
![](fastapigetflag.png) 

it says "only for admin", how can i get the admin role? yes, by updating ur user

![](fastapibefore.png)

and tried to add role variable, and fill it with admin

![](fastapiafter.png)

then go back to '/flag', and execute

![](fastapiflag.png)

Flag: `KashiCTF{m455_4551gnm3n7_ftw_iYTjzfu4Z}`

### Corporate Life 1
###### Desc: The Request Management App is used to view all pending requests for each user. It‚Äôs a pretty basic website, though I heard they were working on something new. Anyway, did you know that one of the disgruntled employees shared some company secrets on the Requests Management App, but it's status was set denied before I could see it. Please find out what it was and spill the tea!
We got only web service, and i started by looking for anything interesting on the application initiallty, but could not find any information

I looked at the network tab and investigated the `_buildManifest.js`
```js
self.__BUILD_MANIFEST=function(e,r,s){return{__rewrites:{afterFiles:[],beforeFiles:[],fallback:[]},__routerFilterStatic:{numItems:0,errorRate:1e-4,numBits:0,numHashes:null,bitArray:[]},__routerFilterDynamic:{numItems:0,errorRate:1e-4,numBits:e,numHashes:null,bitArray:[]},"/":["static/chunks/pages/index-6413244cd5618b98.js"],"/_error":["static/chunks/pages/_error-fde50cb7f1ab27e0.js"],"/v2-testing":["static/chunks/pages/v2-testing-fb612b495bb99203.js"],sortedPages:["/","/_app","/_error","/v2-testing"]}}(0,0,0),self.__BUILD_MANIFEST_CB&&self.__BUILD_MANIFEST_CB();
```
Inside is the `/v2-testing` endpoint, which reveals a new page with a filter

In this `filter` is an SQLi vulnerability, using ' OR 1=1 OR ' results in printing all entries in the table and reveals the flag

#### Solver
```py
import httpx

base_url = "http://kashictf.iitbhucybersec.in:19383"

payload = {"filter": "' OR 1=1 -- "}
response = httpx.post(base_url + "/api/list-v2", json=payload)
print(response.text)
```

## Digital Forensic
### Memories Bring Back
###### Desc: A collection of images, a digital time capsule‚Äîpreserved in this file. But is every picture really just a picture? A photographer once said, ‚ÄúEvery image tells a story, but some stories are meant to stay hidden.‚Äù Maybe it‚Äôs time to inspect the unseen and find what‚Äôs been left behind.
we got a file, when i checked it

![](memoryfile.png)

then i tried to check the partition

![](memorypartition.png)

as you can see, then i switch to use FTK Imager

![](memoryftk.png)

there is 3 directory in partition 1, and when u get into root directory, u will see...

![](memoryftk1.png)

those all files looks so suspicious

![](memoryftk2.png)

there is hidden file .txt in img file, but its fake flag tho, but then i tried the last one, and i got the flag
#### Solver

![](memoryflag.png)

Flag: `KashiCTF{DF1R_g03555_Brrrr}`

### Corruption
###### Desc: A corrupt drive I see...
this is easy foren, we can just strings it then grep it
#### Solver
```bash
strings image.iso  | grep Kashi
```
![](corruptionflag.png)
Flag `KashiCTF{FSCK_mE_B1T_by_b1t_Byt3_by_byT3}`

### SNOWy Evening
###### Desc: A friend of mine , Aakash has gone missing and the only thing we found is this poem...Weirdly, he had a habit of keeping his name as the password.
so i got a .txt file, but its show nothing interest when i cat'ed it, but then i got this
![](SNOWy.png)
its hint for stegsnow (is also in the title)
#### Solver
```bash
stegsnow -p Aakash -C poem.txt
```
![](stegsnow.png)
then open the pastebin
![](Mooooo.png)
after searching for a hour, i finally i got the decoder, its `COW Esolang`!!
![](snowflag.png)
Flag: `KashiCTF{Love_Hurts_5734b5f}`

### Restaurant
###### Desc: I just asked for my favourite pasta and they gave me this. Are these guys STUPID? Maybe in the end they may give me something real. (Wrap the text in KashiCTF{})
so i got pics of pasta, and after searching for smth for a hour, i got nothing, so i just check the hex
![](pastahex.png)
```bash
0000b750: 28bf ffd9 baab aaab bbaa baab abba baba  (...............
0000b760: aaab aaba aaaa abaa baaa aaab aaaa aaaa  ................
0000b770: baba abab aaba baab abab abba aaab aabb  ................
0000b780: abab baba baab abaa aabb aaaa bba0       ..............
```
it is looks like bacon cipher, and i decoded it
#### Solver
![](pastaflag.png)
Flag: `KashiCTF{THEYWEREREALLLLYCOOKING}`

### Look at me
###### Desc: There is something wrong with him.. What can it be??
so i got a image

![](lookatme.png)
#### Solver
and yea after i reverse image search it, it shows about `SilentEye`, it is steganography tools, and just decode to get the flag
![](lookatmeflag.png)
Flag: `KashiCTF{K33p_1t_re4l}`

## Jail
### Easy Jail
###### Desc: I made this calculator. I have a feeling that it's not safe :(
so i got the source code of the netcat service
```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("           _            _       _             ")
print("          | |          | |     | |            ")
print("  ___ __ _| | ___ _   _| | __ _| |_ ___  _ __ ")
print(" / __/ _` | |/ __| | | | |/ _` | __/ _ \| '__|")
print("| (_| (_| | | (__| |_| | | (_| | || (_) | |   ")
print(" \___\__,_|_|\___|\__,_|_|\__,_|\__\___/|_|   ")

def calc(op):
	try : 	
		res = eval(op)
	except :
		return print("Wrong operation")
	return print(f"{op} --> {res}")

def main():
	while True :
		inp = input(">> ")
		calc(inp)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```
there is function eval(op) that will execute our input, and there is no filtering before, so we can exploit it, and this is the payload
#### Solver
```py
__import__('os').system('cat /flag.txt')
```

Flag: `KashiCTF{3V4L_41NT_54F3_53wQLCc7}`

### Easy Jail 2
###### Desc: I made a completely secure calculator this time.
Looking at the jail (compared to the previous) restricts words (such as import), our previous solution `__import__('os').system('cat ../flag.txt')` no longer worked due to import
#### Solver
But we can use a unicode bypass.
I make the following payload: 
```py
__ùò™ùòÆùò±ùò∞ùò≥t__('os').system('cat ../flag.txt')
```
Service:
```bash
$ nc kashictf.iitbhucybersec.in 56261                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 130 ‚Üµ

## Reverse Engineering
### Game 1 - Untitled Game
###### Desc: We made a game.
so we got a file of game, it shows nothing when i try to play it, but i got it by only using `grep` (lol)
#### Solver
![](untgame1.png)

Flag: `KashiCTF{N07_1N_7H3_G4M3}`

### Game 3 - CatSeabank
###### Desc: We made a game.
It is a Unity game (seen from booting it) initially tried using CheatEngine to mess with the money but was a dead end

I use AssetRipper to extract all the file in the exe, and i got file named `flagfile` and it is audio

![](unt3flagfile.png)

Listening to it I identify its likely a spectrogram, I then use an online spectrogram visualiser with the file and see the flag

## Cryptography
### Lost Frequencies
###### Desc: Zeroes, ones, dots and dashes. Data streams in bright flashes. 111 0000 10 111 1000 00 10 01 010 1011 11 111 010 000 0
this is easiest chall, dawg, and ye ofc it was morse code, just decrypt it

### Key Exchange (Up-Solve)
###### Desc: Someone wants to send you a message. But they want something from you first.
so i got nc service and source of the service
```py
from redacted import EllipticCurve, FLAG, EXIT
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad
import hashlib
import random
import json
import os

def encrypt_flag(shared_secret: int):
    sha1 = hashlib.sha1()
    sha1.update(str(shared_secret).encode("ascii"))
    key = sha1.digest()[:16]
    iv = os.urandom(16)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(pad(FLAG, 16))
    data = {}
    data["iv"] = iv.hex()
    data["ciphertext"] = ciphertext.hex()
    return json.dumps(data)

#Curve Parameters (NIST P-384)
p = 39402006196394479212279040100143613805079739270465446667948293404245721771496870329047266088258938001861606973112319
a = -3
b = 27580193559959705877849011840389048093056905856361568521428707301988689241309860865136260764883745107765439761230575
E = EllipticCurve(p,a,b)
G = E.point(26247035095799689268623156744566981891852923491109213387815615900925518854738050089022388053975719786650872476732087,8325710961489029985546751289520108179287853048861315594709205902480503199884419224438643760392947333078086511627871)

n_A = random.randint(2, p-1)
P_A = n_A * G

print(f"\nReceived from Weierstrass:")
print(f"   Here are the curve parameters (NIST P-384)")
print(f"   {p = }")
print(f"   {a = }")
print(f"   {b = }")
print(f"   And my Public Key: {P_A}")

print(f"\nSend to Weierstrass:")
P_B_x = int(input("   Public Key x-coord: "))
P_B_y = int(input("   Public Key y-coord: "))

try:
    P_B = E.point(P_B_x, P_B_y)
except:
    EXIT()

S = n_A * P_B

print(f"\nReceived from Weierstrass:")
print(f"   Message: {encrypt_flag(S.x)}")
```
So basically, we send Sent G as the public key to force the shared secret to be the server‚Äôs public key then we derive the AES key using SHA-1 on the server‚Äôs public key x-coordinate we get the plaintext with a hint (key) which is just Vigen√®re_Decode then we get the flag
