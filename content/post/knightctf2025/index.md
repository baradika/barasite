Uhmm, so yea today ill share yall `KnightCTF` write-up, i want to tell u smth that the ctf is alr end like a month ago (january) but i forgot to post the write up (mb)üòøüòø

KnightCTF is organized by Knight Squad, a cybersecurity team based in India. The CTF competition is known for being a well-structured Jeopardy-style event with challenges in various cybersecurity domains.

In this time, i play with `LastSeenIn2026`, Senior Highschool Cybersecurity/CTF Team, we got position on 130/760 teams, gg (cus we're only 11 grade üòπüòπ)

Also this is my certificate,

I managed to solve 3 Crypto and 3 Rev

and this is my write-up.
## Cryptography
### Reflections in the Random
###### Desc: We‚Äôve uncovered a single string that‚Äôs saturated with possibilities. At first glance, it might resemble standard Base64 output‚Äîbut every attempt to decode it directly results in chaotic gibberish. Some agents suspect an unconventional passphrase or a stray cosmic phenomenon that shifted the bits; others whisper about symmetrical illusions that hide the real message. We even tried old-fashioned classical ciphers‚Äîsimple shifts, sub-harmonic permutations, you name it‚Äîbut the truth remains elusive. All we know is that the message is said to be ‚Äúspun backward from a single pivot,‚Äù though no one agrees what that means. Could it mean time is reversed? Maybe it‚Äôs an obscure numeric transformation. Rumor has it that if you find ‚Äúthe key,‚Äù everything falls into place. Or maybe it‚Äôs simpler than we think‚Äîjust cleverly disguised. Good luck dissecting this anomaly. Remember: ‚ÄúWhen the obvious leads nowhere, perhaps the solution sits right in front of you‚Äîonly viewed from the wrong angle.
If we read the desc correctly, we got hints, `"Spun backward from a single pivot"` it could be XOR, `"Standard Base64 output"` it is base64 encoding, and `"Viewed from the wrong angle"` it could be reverse.

and i got file of the enc

### RandomseniorAdleman
###### Desc: Common Encryption findout by senior Adleman.
this is RSA,

so we just need to find the `p` (A random 256 bit prime number), and this is the solver to find the `p`
#### Solver
```py
from Crypto.Util.number import *
c = 4744275480125761149475439652189568532719997985297643024045625900665305682630452044004013647350658428069718952801828651333880186841289630294789054322237585
q = 81950208731605030173072901497240676460946134422613059941413476068465656250011
e=15537
phi = (q-1)
print(GCD(e, phi))

### Forward, Yet It Falls Back
###### Desc: We discovered a peculiar string that appears standard but yields gibberish under normal decoding. Some analysts detect suspicious symmetry, hinting at reflection or an inverted dimension. Others suspect hidden block boundaries or a ‚Äúbackwards encoding,‚Äù while a few insist it's ‚Äúrotated on a different axis.‚Äù Our only clue: ‚ÄúSymbols may shift forward, but the key is often in reversing what we think is correct.‚Äù Good luck peeling back the layers‚Äîsometimes you must step backward to see what‚Äôs right before you.
so i got a file, let just open it 
![](forwardchall.png)

there is base64 enc, and for the `Key` and `IV` it could be AES-CBC, and also i'll use unpad() to delete those padding after decode AES-CBC, then reverse it. This is the full solver
#### Solver
```py
from Crypto.Util.Padding import *
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from base64 import *

shit = b32decode("G7G2DGQ5SY4DCK5YVUDRROJI3UOAUUNTVR6XKDOKQO4CAAKK2MJA====")
key = b"0123456789ABCDEF"
iv  = b"FEDCBA9876543210"

cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
flag = unpad(cipher.decrypt(shit), 16)
print(flag[::-1])

## Reverse Engineering
### Knight's Droid
###### Desc: For ages, a cryptic mechanical guardian has slumbered beneath the Knight‚Äôs Citadel. Some say it holds powerful secrets once wielded by ancient code-wielding Knights. Many have tried to reactivate the droid and claim its hidden knowledge‚Äîyet none have returned victorious. Will you be the one to solve its riddles and awaken this legendary machine?

i got a zip, when i unzip'ed it, it shows APK, so i just decompile it with jadx, and i found `SecretKeyVerifier.java` 
```java
package com.knightctf.knights_droid;

import android.content.Context;

public class SecretKeyVerifier {
    private static final String ENC_SEG_A = "wp5_GJECD";
    private static final String ENC_SEG_B = "P_u0q_c0p_";
    private static final String ENC_SEG_C = "GYPB{_ykjcn";
    private static final String ENC_SEG_D = "uKqN_Gj1cd7_zN01z_}";

    public static boolean verifyFlag(Context context, String userInput) {
        String fullPackageName = context.getPackageName();
        if (fullPackageName.length() < 20) {
            return false;
        }
        return "GYPB{_ykjcnwp5_GJECDP_u0q_c0p_uKqN_Gj1cd7_zN01z_}".equals(droidMagic(userInput, computeShiftFromKey(fullPackageName.substring(0, 10))));
    }

    private static int computeShiftFromKey(String key) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (char c : key.toCharArray()) {
            sum += c;
        }
        return sum % 26;
    }

    private static String droidMagic(String input, int droidTask) {
        int droidTask2 = ((droidTask % 26) + 26) % 26;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {
                sb.append((char) ((((c - 'A') + droidTask2) % 26) + 65));
            } else if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) {
                sb.append((char) ((((c - 'a') + droidTask2) % 26) + 97));
            } else {
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
#### Solver
`GYPB{_ykjcnwp5_GJECDP_u0q_c0p_uKqN_Gj1cd7_zN01z_}` it is the encrypted flag, and based on this func,
```java
private static String droidMagic(String input, int droidTask) {
        int droidTask2 = ((droidTask % 26) + 26) % 26;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {
                sb.append((char) ((((c - 'A') + droidTask2) % 26) + 65));
            } else if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) {
                sb.append((char) ((((c - 'a') + droidTask2) % 26) + 97));
            } else {
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

it was caesar cipher, cus it use modular operation. Now, we need to brute force it, and this is what i got

### Binary Quest
###### Desc: In the far-off kingdom of Valoria, an ancient relic called the ‚ÄúSacred Flag‚Äù lies hidden within a guarded fortress. Legend says only a true knight of cunning and skill can lay claim to its power. Dare you venture into the shadows and emerge victorious? Your journey begins now‚Äîonward, brave soul, and seize your destiny in the Binary Quest.
so i got file of exe, but when i tried to decompile it, its error, and when i checked the strings, it says upx packer, so i just decompress it back, and i got half of the flag
![](binaryhalfflag.png)

cus i alr unpacked it, so i can decompile it now, and i decompile it using ghidrawr. i got this in `FUN_001010a0`

we got the enc smth there

### Easy Path to the Grail
###### Desc: Brave knight, your quest is simple yet essential‚Äîunlock the secrets hidden in this binary challenge and tread the path to the grail. The journey will test your wits as you reverse the provided binary, uncovering the treasure within.
so i got a file of exe,
![](easypath1.png)
it is just a flag checker program, so lets just decompile it!!
```c

undefined8 main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  undefined8 uVar2;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  undefined local_198 [128];
  char local_118 [264];
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  printf("Enter the password (the original flag): ");
  iVar1 = __isoc99_scanf("%127s",local_198);
  if (iVar1 == 1) {
    transform_input(local_198,local_118);
    iVar1 = strcmp(local_118,"D2C22A62DEA62CCE9EFA0ECC86CE9AFA4ECC6EFAC6162C3636CC76E6A6BE");
    if (iVar1 == 0) {
      printf("Correct! The flag is %s\n",local_198);
    }
    else {
      puts("Wrong password!");
    }
    uVar2 = 0;
  }
  else {
    puts("Input error.");
    uVar2 = 1;
  }
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return uVar2;
}
```
based on `main` func, this program is compare the input with enc strings `D2C22A62DEA62CCE9EFA0ECC86CE9AFA4ECC6EFAC6162C3636CC76E6A6BE`,
```c
void transform_input(char *param_1,char *param_2)

{
  byte bVar1;
  char *local_28;
  char *local_20;
  
  local_28 = param_2;
  for (local_20 = param_1; *local_20 != '\0'; local_20 = local_20 + 1) {
    bVar1 = do_fight(*local_20);
    sprintf(local_28,"%02X",(ulong)bVar1);
    local_28 = local_28 + 2;
  }
  *local_28 = '\0';
  return;
}
```
this func is convert the flag to hex,
```c
byte do_fight(byte param_1)

{
  byte local_1c;
  byte local_d;
  int local_c;
  
  local_d = 0;
  local_1c = param_1;
  for (local_c = 0; local_c < 8; local_c = local_c + 1) {
    local_d = local_d << 1 | local_1c & 1;
    local_1c = local_1c >> 1;
  }
  return local_d;
}
```
and this func is reverse the bit sequence of input byte(8), so we need to reverse first, then decode it from hex
#### Solver 
```py
target_hex = "D2C22A62DEA62CCE9EFA0ECC86CE9AFA4ECC6EFAC6162C3636CC76E6A6BE"

def main(byte_val):
    result = 0
    for _ in range(8):
        result = (result << 1) | (byte_val & 1)
        byte_val >>= 1
    return result

decoded_flag = "".join(chr(main(int(target_hex[i:i+2], 16))) for i in range(0, len(target_hex), 2))

print("Flag:", decoded_flag)
