<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>

<p>Yo! I’m <strong>Baradika</strong> – some say I’m an <strong>ethical hacker</strong> (I just break stuff and hope it’s legal), a <strong>CTF enjoyer</strong>, and a part-time <strong>keyboard warrior</strong>. I mess around with <em>cybersecurity, pentesting, coding weird tools</em>, and sometimes I actually build useful apps (rare, but it happens).</p>

<p>Tools of the trade? <strong>Kali Linux, Python (for hacking stuff), Web Dev</strong>, and whatever else Google tells me to use when things break.</p>

<p>Routine? Honestly, kinda basic: <em>wake up → eat → code (or stare at the screen) → gym (to convince myself I’m productive) → sleep → repeat.</em></p>

<p>Life motto? <em>If it compiles, we vibe. If it doesn’t, we cry (but still vibe).</em></p>
