>Hii!! My name is Fase Rais `b4r`adika, i'm a <strong>CTF enthusiast</strong>, and a part-time <strong>Professional Procrastinator</strong>. i'm 17y/o and i mess around with <em>cybersecurity, pentesting, coding weird tools</em>, and sometimes I actually build useful apps (rare, but it happens).

I hope you find these blogs useful, so stay safe, and take care of urself!! :D
